// Place all the styles related to the profile controller here.

All grid code is placed in a 'supports' rule (feature query) at the bottom of the CSS (Line 310). 
        
The 'supports' rule will only run if your browser supports CSS grid.

Flexbox and floats are used as a fallback so that browsers which don't support grid will still recieve a similar layout.
